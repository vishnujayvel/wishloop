  Thin session manager for Loki Mode. Configures, launches, monitors, and babysits
  Loki sessions. Loki handles all coding, testing, review, and documentation internally.
  Wishloop handles work intake, proposal enrichment, session configuration, PR feedback
  loops, and cross-session concerns.

  Triggers on: "openspec", "loki", "SDLC", "run the loop", "wishloop", "worktrunk" + parallel context,
  "fix these bugs" + loki context, "build X from scratch" + openspec context,
  "continue where we left off" with openspec/changes/, greenfield projects with openspec/ directory,
  "archive the change", "verify and triage", "drain", "wishloop --drain".

  DO NOT USE FOR one-off brainstorming (use superpowers:brainstorming),
  web/topic research (use deep-research), Kiro-based SDLC (use pdlc-autopilot),
  day planning (use daily-copilot), practice tracking (use practice-tracker),
  or generic "fix this bug" without openspec/loki context.

# Wishloop v2

Thin session manager for Loki Mode. Classify work, spec it via OpenSpec CLI, configure and launch Loki, monitor the session, babysit the PR, loop.

## Prerequisites

- **openspec CLI** — `openspec` (spec generation)
- **loki CLI** — `loki start` (autonomous execution, requires `--dangerously-skip-permissions`)
- **gh CLI** — `gh issue create` / `gh issue list` (bug filing and feedback loop)
- **Worktrunk** *(recommended)* — `brew install worktrunk && wt config shell install` (worktree lifecycle, merge automation). Optional — the skill falls back to manual git worktrees when not installed.

## Design Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **P1: Configure, Don't Reimplement** | If Loki has a capability, configure it via env vars, flags, or CLAUDE.md. Never rewrite it. |
| **P2: Monitor, Fix Post-Session** | Lightweight alive/dead/stalled check during session. Fix gaps after. |
| **P3: Match Session Type to Work** | `loki start --parallel` for features. `loki run #N --pr` for single bugs. `loki quick` for review fixes. |
| **P4: Strong Proposals, Thin Wrapper** | Quality of the Loki session = quality of the proposal. Invest in enrichment. |
| **P5: Upstream When Generic** | If a Wishloop feature is generic, contribute upstream. Plan B after 2 weeks. |
| **P6: External Interface Only** | Wishloop calls ONLY Loki's public CLI. NEVER internal run.sh functions. Zero `.loki/` file coupling. |

---

## Drain Mode

Autonomous loop that processes ALL open GitHub issues until the backlog is empty. Wraps v2 Steps 1-6 in a fetch-prioritize-launch-monitor-babysit cycle.

### Invocation

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/drain.sh                          # drain all open issues
bash <skill-path>/scripts/drain.sh --label bug              # drain only bugs
bash <skill-path>/scripts/drain.sh --label refactor --max-iterations 3
```

Or via the skill trigger: `wishloop --drain` / `wishloop --drain --label bug`

### How It Works

```text
FETCH (gh issue list) → STOP? (zero = exit) → PRIORITIZE → RESUME? →
  PICK → CLASSIFY → LAUNCH (loki run #N --pr) →
  MONITOR (loki status --json, 5min polls) →
  POST (docs, learnings, archival) →
  BABYSIT (CodeRabbit → loki quick → merge) →
LOOP
```

### Key Design: GitHub Issues ARE the State

No local backlog file. GitHub Issues are the single source of truth:
- Open issues = work remaining
- Closed issues = work done  
- Issue labels = priority and filtering
- PR state = current work-in-progress

### Session Resumption

On re-invoke, drain mode checks:
1. `.wishloop/state.json` — what step were we in?
2. `gh pr list --state open` — if any, resume at BABYSIT
3. `loki status --json` — if running, resume at MONITOR
4. If neither, fetch open issues and start fresh

### Monitoring (via `loki status --json`)

The drain loop polls `loki status --json` every 5 minutes to detect:
- `completed` → proceed to post-session
- `stopped` → proceed to post-session
- `running` → continue polling (with stall detection)
- `unknown` → attempt `loki resume`, then crash recovery

### Emergency Stop (`loki stop`)

If the session is stalled (iteration unchanged for 15+ minutes), drain mode runs:
```bash
loki stop     # Kill stalled session
loki resume   # Restart from last checkpoint
```

### Priority Tiers

```text
critical > bug > auto-detected > refactor > enhancement > documentation
Within same tier: smaller effort first (body length heuristic)
```

### Cumulative Summary (on exit)

```text
=== Drain Complete ===
Iterations: 3 | Duration: 47 min | Commits: 12 | Files: 8
Issues at start: 5 | Resolved: 4 | Filed: 1 | Remaining: 2
Loki sessions: 3 | PRs merged: 4 | Quick fixes: 2
```

---

## Step 1: Intake

Classify the work request into a type and route accordingly.

| Signal | Work Type | Spec? | Loki Session Type |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| "build X from scratch", greenfield | **Greenfield** | Full OpenSpec init | `loki start --parallel` |
| "add X", "integrate Y", new feature | **Feature** | `openspec new change` | `loki start --parallel` |
| "refactor", "migrate from X to Y" | **Refactor** | `openspec new change` (MODIFIED) | `loki start --parallel` |
| "fix #N", single issue | **Bug fix (single)** | None | `loki run #N --pr` |
| "fix these bugs", bug list | **Bug batch** | Batched changes | `loki start --parallel` per wave |
| "add tests", "E2E coverage" | **Testing** | Test-focused change | `loki start --parallel` |
| "write docs", "API docs" | **Documentation** | None | `loki docs generate` (no session) |
| "design X", "architecture for Y" | **Architecture** | Proposal + design only | None |
| "research", "spike", "evaluate" | **Research** | None | None |
| "audit X", "review Y for Z" | **Audit** | None | None |
| "rethink the X", "brainstorm" | **Product Thinking** | None | None |

**Non-code work types** (Architecture, Research, Audit, Documentation, Product Thinking): Load the matching template from `templates/` and skip to output. No Loki session needed.

| Work Type | Template |
|-----------|----------|
| Architecture (HLD) | `templates/hld.md` |
| Architecture (LLD) | `templates/lld.md` |
| Research | `templates/research.md` |
| Audit | `templates/audit.md` |
| Documentation | `templates/docs.md` |

---

## Step 2: Spec + Enrich

For code work types, produce the input that Loki needs.

### 2a. Generate spec

**Greenfield:** `openspec init --tools claude && openspec new change <name>`

**Feature/Refactor/Testing:** `openspec new change <name>` — write `proposal.md` with problem, goals, scope, non-goals, testing strategy, and exit criteria (defines the completion promise).

**Bug fix (single):** No spec needed. `loki run #N --pr` imports the GitHub issue directly.

**Bug fix in specced domain:** If the bug touches code governed by an existing OpenSpec domain spec, use `loki start --openspec` instead.

**Bug batch:** Run the intelligent batching algorithm (see `references/batching-algorithm.md`), then generate a minimal proposal per wave.

Loki can start from just a proposal. Only generate full OpenSpec artifacts (design, specs, tasks) for brownfield modifications needing structured delta context.

Validate: `openspec validate <name>` — all artifacts must pass before proceeding.

### 2b. Enrich proposal

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/enrich-proposal.sh <project-dir> <proposal-path>
```

Injects: relevant file paths + line numbers, CLAUDE.md rules, test file patterns, build/run/test commands, recent git history, tech stack summary.

### 2c. Proposal quality gate

Before launching Loki, verify the proposal has:
- [ ] At least one file path reference
- [ ] At least one acceptance criterion
- [ ] A testing strategy
- [ ] The project's build command

Do not launch Loki with an incomplete brief — thin proposals cause wasted discovery time.

---

## Step 3: Configure

Before launching Loki, set the environment and clean state.

### 3a. Clean stale worktrees

```bash
git worktree prune 2>/dev/null
```

**Do NOT `rm -rf .loki/`.** Loki's initialization is additive — it preserves valid state. Destroying `.loki/` deletes checkpoints needed for `loki resume`.

### 3b. Pre-launch validation

```bash
loki doctor    # Verify prerequisites, skill symlinks, provider availability
```

If `loki doctor` fails: print diagnostic output. Do not proceed until doctor passes.

### 3c. Session configuration

Source the static config and compose the completion promise dynamically:

```bash
# Source static process config
set -a && source .wishloop/loki.env && set +a

# Extract task-specific exit criteria from the proposal
TASK_CRITERIA=""
if [ -f "$PROPOSAL_PATH" ]; then
  TASK_CRITERIA=$(sed -n '/## Exit Criteria/,/^## /p' "$PROPOSAL_PATH" | grep -E '^\s*[-*]' | sed 's/^[\s*-]*//' | tr '\n' '; ' | sed 's/; $//')
fi

# Compose full promise: task criteria + process bar
if [ -n "$TASK_CRITERIA" ]; then
  export LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE="${TASK_CRITERIA}. THEN: ${WISHLOOP_PROCESS_BAR}"
else
  export LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE="${WISHLOOP_PROCESS_BAR}"
fi
```

This ensures every session knows both WHAT to build (from the proposal) and HOW to deliver it (PR + review + respond).

### 3d. CLAUDE.md preparation

Ensure the project's CLAUDE.md contains:
- Build/test/lint commands
- Project conventions
- Any OpenSpec spec references
- Learnings format instruction and PR review handling:

```markdown
## Loki Session Rules

### Learnings
When you encounter errors, unexpected behavior, or learn something non-obvious,
ALWAYS update CONTINUITY.md's "## Mistakes & Learnings" section with bullet points:
- **What Failed:** [specific error]
- **Why It Failed:** [root cause]
- **How to Prevent:** [concrete action]

### PR Review Handling
After creating a PR, you MUST:
1. Wait for CodeRabbit to post its review (poll `gh pr checks` every 90 seconds)
2. Read all review comments: `gh pr view <N> --comments`
3. For each comment: fix the issue in code, then reply to the comment thread
   with what you changed: `gh pr review <N> --comment --body "Fixed: <description>"`
4. Push all fixes, then wait for CodeRabbit to re-review
5. Only declare completion when all review threads are resolved
```

### 3e. Worktrunk configuration (if available)

If `wt` is on PATH and no `.worktrunk.toml` exists, generate one with detected build system hooks.

### 3f. Checkpoint commit

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "checkpoint: prep for loki session (<change-name>)"
```

Commit spec files, enriched proposal, and CLAUDE.md changes BEFORE creating worktrees.

### 3g. Launch

| Work Type | Launch Command |
|-----------|---------------|
| Feature/Greenfield/Refactor | `wt switch -c -x "loki start --parallel --openspec openspec/changes/<name>" <name>` |
| Bug fix (single) | `loki run #N --pr` |
| Bug batch wave | `wt switch -c -x "loki start --parallel --openspec openspec/changes/wave-N" wave-N` |

**Background fallback (no Worktrunk):**
```bash
nohup loki start --parallel --openspec openspec/changes/<name> > /tmp/loki-<name>.log 2>&1 &
LOKI_PID=$!
echo "Loki PID: $LOKI_PID"
```

If launch fails: check `/tmp/loki-<change>.log`. If Loki exits within 30 seconds, log the error.

**Initialize state tracking:**
```bash
echo '{"step":"session","change":"<name>","pid":PID,"startedAt":"ISO"}' > .wishloop/state.json
```

---

## Step 3.5: Monitor

While the Loki session runs, Wishloop monitors session health via Loki's public CLI.

**For Worktrunk sessions (`wt switch -c -x`):** Worktrunk blocks until the command completes. Check exit code: 0 = completed, non-zero = crashed.

**For background sessions:** Run the monitoring script every 5 minutes:

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/gardening-check.sh <project-dir> <change-name>
# Or via /loop: /loop 5m bash <skill-path>/scripts/gardening-check.sh . my-change
```

The monitoring script uses `loki status --json` to check session health:

```bash
STATUS_JSON=$(loki status --json 2>/dev/null)
SESSION_STATUS=$(echo "$STATUS_JSON" | jq -r '.status')
ITERATION=$(echo "$STATUS_JSON" | jq -r '.iteration')
```

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `completed` | Session finished | Proceed to Step 4 |
| `stopped` | Stopped (by user or error) | Check logs, proceed to Step 4 |
| `running` | Still working | Continue polling |
| `unknown` | No active session | Check PID, may have crashed |

**Stall detection:** If `iteration` hasn't changed across 3 consecutive polls (15 minutes), emit a warning.

**Crash recovery:**
1. Log crash with error details
2. Clean orphaned worktrees: `git worktree prune`
3. Update `.wishloop/state.json` with `{"status": "crashed", "error": "..."}`
4. Suggest: `loki resume` (continue from last checkpoint)
5. Or: restart from Step 3 (clean launch)

**Emergency stop:** `loki stop` — kills a stalled session immediately.

### Wishloop Status Dashboard

When checking session status, display this combined view showing what Wishloop configured and how Loki is progressing:

```bash
# Gather data
STATUS_JSON=$(loki status --json 2>/dev/null)
STATE_JSON=$(cat .wishloop/state.json 2>/dev/null)
PROMISE=$(echo "$LOKI_COMPLETION_PROMISE" | fold -w 60)

# Display
echo "╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗"
echo "║  WISHLOOP STATUS                                        ║"
echo "╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣"
echo "║  Change:  $(echo "$STATE_JSON" | jq -r '.change // "unknown"')"
echo "║  Step:    $(echo "$STATE_JSON" | jq -r '.step // "unknown"')"
echo "║  Started: $(echo "$STATE_JSON" | jq -r '.startedAt // "unknown"')"
echo "╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣"
echo "║  LOKI SESSION                                           ║"
echo "║  Status:    $(echo "$STATUS_JSON" | jq -r '.status')"
echo "║  Phase:     $(echo "$STATUS_JSON" | jq -r '.phase')"
echo "║  Iteration: $(echo "$STATUS_JSON" | jq -r '.iteration')"
echo "║  Tasks:     $(echo "$STATUS_JSON" | jq -r '.task_counts.completed')/$(echo "$STATUS_JSON" | jq -r '.task_counts.total') completed"
echo "║  PID:       $(echo "$STATUS_JSON" | jq -r '.pid')"
echo "╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣"
echo "║  COMPLETION PROMISE                                     ║"
echo "║  $PROMISE"
echo "╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣"
echo "║  PROPOSAL                                               ║"
echo "║  $(head -1 "$PROPOSAL_PATH" 2>/dev/null || echo 'N/A')"
echo "║  Exit criteria: $(grep -c '^\s*[-*]' <(sed -n '/## Exit Criteria/,/^## /p' "$PROPOSAL_PATH" 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null || echo '0') items"
echo "╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣"
echo "║  PR STATUS                                              ║"
echo "║  $(gh pr list --json number,title,state --jq '.[0] | "#\(.number) \(.title) [\(.state)]"' 2>/dev/null || echo 'No open PR')"
echo "╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝"
```

This dashboard is displayed:
- At the start of each gardening check (Step 3.5)
- When the user asks for status
- In the cumulative summary at loop exit

**Action directives from monitoring:**

| Directive | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `ACTION: SESSION_COMPLETE` | Loki completed successfully | Stop monitoring. Run Step 4 immediately. |
| `ACTION: SESSION_STALLED` | No progress for 15+ minutes | Warn user. Consider `loki stop` + `loki resume`. |
| `ACTION: SESSION_CRASHED` | Session died unexpectedly | Log error. Suggest `loki resume` or clean restart. |

---

## Step 4: Post-Session

After Loki's session ends (completion promise fulfilled or max iterations):

### 4a. Learnings verification

Loki's run.sh automatically calls its extraction pipeline at session end. Wishloop verifies it produced output:

```bash
MISTAKES=$(wc -l < ~/.loki/learnings/mistakes.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
if [ "$MISTAKES" -le 1 ]; then
  # Loki's extraction found nothing — fall back to interactive extraction
  # Prompt user: What surprised you? What did Loki get wrong? New patterns?
  # Write to ~/.local/share/wishloop/learnings.json
fi
```

**Time-boxed exception:** This fallback exists because Loki's extraction pipeline currently produces empty output. Step 3d's CLAUDE.md instruction is designed to fix the root cause. Remove the fallback after 3 consecutive sessions produce JSONL with > 1 line.

### 4b. Documentation validation

```bash
loki docs check 2>/dev/null
```

If exit code is 1 (docs stale/missing) AND `--parallel` was used:
```bash
loki docs generate    # Fallback: generate full doc suite
```

### 4c. Run archival

```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/capture-run.sh <project> <change> <checkpoint-hash> <start-time> <pid>
```

Records: commit count, files changed, build/test results, duration, bugs found.

### 4d. Independent build/test verification

Run the project's own build and test commands:
```bash
npm run build && npm test    # or equivalent
```

If build or tests fail: file a GitHub issue with details. Proceed to Step 5 — the babysitter handles fixes.

---

## Step 5: PR Babysitter

After the Loki session creates a PR:

### 5a. Wait for CodeRabbit

Poll `gh pr checks <N>` every 90 seconds. Detect "Currently processing" in recent comments.

**Timeout:** If CodeRabbit hasn't responded within 10 minutes, proceed with `loki ci --pr` as the sole quality gate.

### 5b. Address review comments

When unresolved review threads are detected:

```bash
PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view <N> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')
git checkout "$PR_BRANCH"

loki quick "Read and address all review comments on PR #<N>. \
  Run 'gh pr view <N> --comments' to see them. \
  Fix each issue, commit, and push."
```

If `loki quick` fails (3 iterations exhausted, unresolved threads remain):
1. Generate a focused proposal describing remaining comments
2. Launch `loki start` on the same PR branch with `LOKI_GITHUB_PR=false`
3. **Circuit breaker:** After 3 escalations for the same PR, pause and request user input.

**Multiple PRs (bug batch):**
```bash
bash <skill-path>/scripts/pr-babysitter.sh once
```

### 5c. Final quality gate

```bash
loki ci --pr --fail-on critical,high
```

Exit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = findings exceed threshold, 2 = error. On 1: file issue and continue. On 2: log warning, proceed.

### 5d. Merge

```bash
# With Worktrunk:
wt merge main

# Without:
gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch
```

Auto-merge criteria: CI passes, no unresolved blocking comments, no merge conflicts. Only pause for user input when blocking comments require design decisions.

---

## Step 6: Loop

After PR is merged:

1. `openspec archive <change>` (if OpenSpec was used)
2. Clean up: `git worktree prune`
3. Fetch open issues: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels`
4. If zero open issues: print "Pipeline clean" and exit
5. Run intelligent batching algorithm (see `references/batching-algorithm.md`)
6. Generate proposal for Wave 1
7. Return to Step 2

**Exit conditions:** Zero open issues, max iterations reached (default 5), or user types "stop."

**Cooldown:** 2 minutes between iterations. User can type "stop," "skip," or provide steering input.

### Cumulative summary (on exit):
```text
=== Wishloop Complete ===
Iterations: {N} | Duration: {M} min | Commits: {C} | Files: {F}
Issues at start: {N} | Filed: {N} | Resolved: {N} | Remaining: {N}
Learnings captured: {N}
```

## State Tracking

`.wishloop/state.json` tracks pipeline position for resumption across sessions:

```bash
# At Step 3g (launch):
{"step": "session", "change": "<name>", "pid": PID, "startedAt": "ISO"}

# At Step 3.5 (session completes):
{"step": "post-session", "change": "<name>", "completedAt": "ISO"}

# At Step 5 (babysitter):
{"step": "babysitter", "pr": N, "change": "<name>"}

# At Step 6 (loop):
{"step": "loop", "iteration": N}
```

## Scripts
